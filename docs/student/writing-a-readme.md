# Writing a Professional README.md

When you publish an assignment as a portfolio project, the `README.md` file is
usually the first thing a visitor sees. A good README helps an instructor,
classmate, recruiter, or developer understand the project quickly without
having to read the source code first.

This guide is for a public portfolio repository. Before publishing course
work, follow [Publish Your Completed Assignment](publishing.md) and get your
instructor's permission. Do not publish hidden tests, private course material,
solutions that your instructor has not approved, credentials, or other
students' information.

## What your README should do

Your README should answer these questions in a few minutes:

- What problem does this project solve?
- What did you build or contribute?
- What technologies and techniques does it demonstrate?
- How can someone set it up, run it, and test it?
- Where can a reader learn more or see the project in action?

GitHub's [guidance on repository README files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
recommends explaining what the project does, why it is useful, how to get
started, where to get help, and who maintains it. A portfolio README should
make those answers especially easy to scan.

There is no single universal README standard. Use GitHub's conventions and
[Google's README style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/READMEs.html)
as practical references, then adapt the content to your project and audience.

## A portfolio-friendly structure

The following sections work well for a completed programming assignment. Use
only the sections that help explain your project; a short, accurate README is
better than a long README full of boilerplate.

### 1. Title and one-sentence summary

Start with the project name and a plain-language description. The first
sentence should tell a visitor what the program does, not merely name the
language or course.

~~~markdown
# Student Grade Statistics

A Python command-line program that reads assignment scores and reports summary
statistics, including the minimum, maximum, and average score.
~~~

Choose a specific repository name, such as `student-grade-statistics`, rather
than a vague name such as `final-project` or `assignment-3`.

### 2. Project context and your contribution

Be transparent about the project's origin. For coursework, say that it began
as a course assignment and identify the parts you implemented or extended.
This gives readers useful context and accurately represents your work.

For example:

~~~markdown
## Overview

This project began as an assignment in an introductory Python course. I
implemented the statistics module, input validation, and automated tests. The
starter repository supplied the pytest configuration and the initial module
interface.
~~~

Do not claim responsibility for starter code, instructor-provided tests, or
work completed by a partner. If you worked with others, describe the
collaboration and your own contribution. Credit external sources, libraries,
and substantial assistance where appropriate.

### 3. Highlights and technology

List the most relevant features and technologies. Focus on evidence of your
skills rather than a long list of every tool used.

~~~markdown
## Highlights

- Validates malformed and out-of-range input.
- Separates the statistics calculations from command-line input/output.
- Uses pytest for repeatable automated tests.
- Handles empty input and duplicate scores explicitly.
~~~

You can add a concise technology list after the highlights:

~~~markdown
**Technology:** Python 3.12, pytest, pip, GitHub Actions
~~~

### 4. Demo or example

Show the result when a visual or text example will help. For a command-line
assignment, a short terminal transcript is often enough:

```text
$ python3 -m src.statistics scores.txt
Count: 5
Average: 84.60
Minimum: 72
Maximum: 96
```

If the project has a graphical interface or web component, consider an
approved screenshot, short recording, or link to a live demo. Give images
descriptive alternative text, keep media small, and do not include private
course content or personal data.

### 5. Requirements and setup

State what a reader needs before starting: operating system assumptions,
runtime versions, package managers, and other dependencies. Then
give commands that work from a fresh clone.

~~~markdown
## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `pip`

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
~~~

Use the actual commands for the project. Check them from a clean checkout so
that the instructions do not depend on files or settings that exist only on
your computer. If the public repository has a more detailed guide, link to it
with a relative path, for example `[Setup guide](docs/student/setup.md)`.

### 6. Usage

Explain how to run the program and show the important arguments or input
format. Include one small example and describe the expected result. Avoid
making the reader infer command-line syntax from the source code.

~~~markdown
## Usage

```bash
python3 -m src.statistics path/to/scores.txt
```

The input file contains one numeric score per line. The program prints the
number of scores and their summary statistics.
~~~

### 7. Tests

Tell readers how to run the tests and briefly describe what they cover. A
portfolio README should show that you verify behavior, not just that the
program runs once.

~~~markdown
## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

The test suite covers normal input, empty input, duplicate values, and invalid
scores.
~~~

Do not describe private or hidden grading tests. Mention only tests that are
intended to be visible in the public repository and that your instructor has
approved for publication.

### 8. Design notes

Use a short section to show how you approached the problem. Explain one or two
meaningful design decisions, trade-offs, or challenges—for example, why the
calculation logic is separated from file parsing, or how invalid input is
handled. This is more useful to a portfolio reader than a line-by-line tour of
the code.

~~~markdown
## Design notes

Input parsing is kept separate from the statistics functions so the
calculations can be tested without reading a file. Invalid records are
reported and skipped instead of terminating the entire run.
~~~

### 9. Project structure

Give a small map of the repository when the structure is not self-explanatory.
Include only the directories and files that help a new reader navigate.

```text
.
├── src/                 # Application and library source code
├── tests/               # Public unit tests
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

Keep the tree current when files move.

### 10. Limitations and future improvements

State known limitations honestly, especially if the assignment intentionally
has a small scope. A short list of sensible next steps demonstrates judgment
and gives readers ideas for future work.

~~~markdown
## Future improvements

- Add support for CSV input with a header row.
- Add a JSON output option.
- Improve diagnostics by reporting the line number of each invalid record.
~~~

Do not promise features that are already required but unfinished. Describe
unfinished work accurately or leave it out of a completed portfolio version.

### 11. Attribution, license, and contact

Identify the course context, collaborators, major dependencies, and external
references. If the project is based on starter material, say so without
including restricted assignment details.

Add a license only when you have permission to publish the code under that
license. GitHub explains [how repository licensing works](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
and points to [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) for help
understanding common options. A public repository without a license is not
automatically free for others to reuse.

You may finish with links that help a professional reader find you:

~~~markdown
## Links

- [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/your-username)
- [Project discussion or report](docs/project-report.md)
~~~

Do not put personal phone numbers, home addresses, API keys, tokens, or other
sensitive information in a public README.

## Writing and formatting practices

- Put the most important information near the top. Many visitors will skim
  before deciding whether to read further.
- Use descriptive headings and short paragraphs. GitHub can generate an
  outline from Markdown headings; its [basic Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
  explains the supported syntax.
- Prefer copy-and-pasteable commands in fenced code blocks. Explain the
  directory from which each command should be run when that is not obvious.
- Use relative links for files within the repository, and test every link
  after publishing. Avoid links to private course systems that a portfolio
  visitor cannot access.
- Use screenshots and badges only when they communicate something useful.
  Keep badges current, and add alternative text to images.
- Write in a professional, direct voice. Replace claims such as “this is the
  best program” with concrete evidence such as features, test coverage, or a
  working demo.
- Remove template instructions, empty sections, TODO markers, and placeholder
  text before publishing.
- Update the README when the setup commands, dependencies, or behavior change.

## A starter outline

Copy this outline into the root `README.md`, then replace every placeholder and
remove sections that do not apply:

~~~markdown
# Project Name

One sentence describing what the project does and who it is for.

## Overview

Explain the project context and your contribution. If it began as coursework,
say so at a high level.

## Highlights

- Feature or technical accomplishment
- Feature or technical accomplishment
- Feature or technical accomplishment

## Demo

Add a screenshot, terminal example, video, or link if one is useful.

## Requirements

List the compiler/runtime, tools, versions, and dependencies.

## Setup

Give tested commands for a fresh clone.

## Usage

Show the main command and a small example.

## Tests

Explain how to run the public tests and what they cover.

## Design notes

Describe one or two important decisions or trade-offs.

## Project structure

Show a concise directory tree if it helps readers navigate.

## Limitations and future improvements

List known limitations and realistic next steps.

## Attribution and license

Credit collaborators, starter material, dependencies, and external sources.
State the license if one applies.
~~~
